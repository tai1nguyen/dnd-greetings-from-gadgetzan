## Description
**Matilda**, a local human housewife, asks the party to help find out why her lizardfolk husband, **Gix**, is behaving strangely. He no longer sleeps at home with her and has no interest in his family. Outwardly, to society, the husband behaves normally and goes about his day as if nothing has changed.

### Why Gix Is Acting Strange
Several weeks ago, while investigating the sewers as part of his guild duties, Gix was attacked by a mind flayer and turned into a thrall. Gix, being a lizardfolk, already exhibited strange behaviors before this and as such, to outsiders, nothing has changed. Gix's wife on the other hand notices his change. When confronted, Gix feigned ignorance. The mind flayer is using Gix to scout out the city and steal knowledge. As a sewer maintenance manager Gix is very familiar with the sewer lines under the city. Every night Gix will return to the sewers with a backpack filled with notes about the city and how it operates. 

### Matilda
Wife to Gix, is worried something is wrong with her husband but she has no means to prove it. She will do everything she can to figure out why Gix has changed. If the party doesn't help Matilda she will take matters into her own hands, following Gix into the sewers.

### Gix's Routine
Gix starts his morning at the local guild office in the southern district collating notes of the many sewage pathways underneath the city. Around noon, he will leave the office and make way to a local cafe for lunch. After lunch Gix will make his way to the library. Gix will remain in the library for the remainder of the day. At night Gix sneaks into the sewers via an entrance in the docks district.

If Gix is confronted by the party and they inform him about his Wife's suspicions, Gix will try and convince the party to lie for him, he offers to double their reward in exchange.

### At the Guild Office
The guild office is a small one story building. It has two rooms, a waiting room and Gix's office. Gix has a receptionist who will greet everyone that enters the office. In the backroom Gix is making furiously going over all the notes his guild has on the cities sewer system.

At noon, Gix will leave the office to get lunch at a local cafe. Gix doesn't spend much time in the cafe and orders two meals. He leaves after he finishes his first meal and saves the second meal for later.

### At the Library
Gix will be constantly shifting between wings of the library. His is seeking out history books on the culture of the city, the world and past wars. Gix will frequently ask the librarians for help in locating certain books.

### At the Sewer
Gix will proceed with caution when entering the sewers. If he notices anyone following him he will immediately flee deeper into the sewers. After several hours Gix will enter into the underdark. At this point Gix has entered the domain of his mind flayer master and is informed of any party following him. Gix will lead the party to a narrow passage way with no exit. There he and several other thralls will ambush the party.

## Conclusion
If the party accepts Gix's proposal, he will continue to provide the mind flayer with information on the city and attacks against the citizenry and reports of strange behaviors will continue and grow.

If the party successfully captures or frees Gix from his charmed condition, Gix will tell the players what happened to him several weeks earlier. He will tell the party of a large fortress in the underdark where charmed citizens are congregating.

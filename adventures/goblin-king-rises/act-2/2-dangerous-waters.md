## Dangerous Waters
While traveling through the forest, Krel takes the characters on a shorter path back to town. Soon the characters come across a relatively quick moving river. Rocks are spaced out across the river enough to cross it with a few jumps. Unfortunately for the characters giant frogs lurk just below the water waiting for their next meal.

### Hook
>A wide river blocks your travel. Luckily it looks like a number of large rocks dot the river, making a dry crossing possible with a few hops and jumps.

### The River
The river is 50 feet wide. As the water level of the river changes the rocks become more or less covered with water, resulting in many of them being slick with moss. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) or (Survival) score of 14 or higher sees that the rocks appear slick. Noticing the slippery rocks allows the characters to make a more difficult check to cross the river, while avoiding the slippery rocks.

If the characters do not notice the slippery rocks, they must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check at disadvantage or fall into the water. Character that know about the slick rocks must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid the moss covered rocks and cross the river safely.

The river is flowing fast enough that any creature without a swimming speed who falls in must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be swept 60 feet downriver. Such a creature in the river can spend its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature can reduce the distance traveled by the amount of its walking speed and move toward a bank. On a failed check, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

Lurking in the river are four **giant frogs**, two of which are 30 feet upriver of the rocks and two are 90 feet downriver. A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher sees the frogs upriver.

>A frog that successfully attacks a target with its bite automatically grapples the character. After they succeed on the bite the frog pulls the character in the water. This may cause the giant frog to be subject to an attack of opportunity by adjacent characters.

## Conclusion
The characters successfully cross the river and continue on their way.

>Downstream remnants of the frogs past victims can be found with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The treasure includes 50 gp worth of mundane equipment and a pouch with 25 gp and 30 sp.

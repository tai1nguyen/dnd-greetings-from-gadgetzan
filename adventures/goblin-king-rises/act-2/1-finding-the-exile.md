### 1. General Store
The general store is a medium building about 30 feet in width and 60 feet in length. It has only one floor and no roof. Inside the characters can see 4 rows of shelves lined before them. Each shelf is empty except for the odd piece of clutter or debris.

To the right wall sits a half rotted counter. The old store's cash register still standing proud against the withering of time. There is no money inside the cash register.

On the left wall there are posters and adverts that are too faded or rotted to be legible.

The hardwood floor of the building has been rotting from years of neglect. Each character attempting to move through the building must beat a DC 9 Dexterity check or slip and fall prone.

### 2. Tavern
The tavern has seen better days, its front door is hanging haphazardly on its hinges. The windows facing the characters are all broken and shattered. Directly in front of the entrance to the tavern, the bar still stands with visible signs of the wood warping under its varnish.

The beams of the tavern are falling apart and occasionally debris will fall to the ground. As characters move around they must succeed a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

Behind the counter is a hidden safe, characters discover it if they succeed a DC 12 Wisdom (Investigation) check. The safe can be forced open by succeeding a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check or picked open with successful DC 14 Dexterity check.

The chest contains 50 gp, 25 sp, rope, and a dagger.

### 4. Inn
Approaching the inn the characters can hear yelling coming from the inside. Before the characters can react a shambling mound bursts forth from the inn, engulfed in flames. The creature lashes out at the nearest character.

After the creature is defeated, **Krel**, the goblin exile, appears from behind an overturned table and greets the player. He looks hurt but is happy to see them.

## Conclusion
Krel thanks the characters profusely for saving his life and for defeating the shambling mound. He warns them that the commotion of the fight will have attracted the attention of the hunters tasked with killing him. Krel asks the characters to protect him and that if they can get him safely back to town he will help them take down the Goblin King.

Along the journey back, the characters may ask Krel for more information on the Goblin King. Krel will explain that he had been exiled from the Goblin Kings royal court for disagreeing with his plans for a "civilized" goblin society. He goes on to explain that the Goblin King seeks to take over Riverdale and use it as the foundation for his kingdom. He plans to continue taking over more and more settlements until his goblin kingdom rivals that of man.

If asked about what the Goblin King looks like, Krel does not know his name, as the goblins only ever refer to him as king. He describes the King as a giant goblin of great strength who loves to smash his enemies with his great club.

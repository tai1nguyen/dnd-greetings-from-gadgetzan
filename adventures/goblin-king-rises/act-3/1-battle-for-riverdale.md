## Battle for Riverdale
The characters return to town with news of Krel's death, information on the Goblin King's location and his plans for a retaliatory assualt. On their way to give this information they are stopped on the street by Greg Thompson who asks for a moment of their time. The characters can choose to ignore him and head straight to the mayor.

>If the characters follow Greg he gifts Death's Bane to the character with the highest Strength. He explains that he had been spending time preparing it for combat. He feels that the sword would have a better home with someone with real experience and can think of no better person.

The characters meet Kensey at her home and deliver the news. Kensey informs them that they need to immediately prepare the town defenses. She believes that if the goblins are going to attack it will be with a show of force meant to crush the will of the town and any nearby settlements. They mean to make her home and her people an example. She asks the characters to please spend time training the townspeople for combat in the coming days.

### The Battle Begins
The next day, as the characters start to make preparations for the upcoming fight, a mysterious figures approaches them.

Cloaked in all black, **Gilena Mistwalker** introduces herself to the characters in the middle of the streets. Gilena is here to oversee the goblin army in its conquest of riverdale. She does not fight the characters directly and only makes an appearance to signal the attack. After the signal is made Gilena disappears.

>Characters that beat a DC 9 passive Wisdom (Perception) check recognizes her voice as the same one that they had heard several weeks earlier when the goblins had ambushed them at the inn.

>Gilena glances around the town, almost as if she was looking for something. Her gaze returns to you and she repeats the last words you had heard from her.
>
>"There will be no second warning..."
>
>Before you can react she points her hands over to the tavern. A massive ball of fire materializes before her and once at critical mass she hurls it at the building. A flash of blinding light, a searing pain and then nothing but ringing fills your ears.
>
>The explosion catches everyone off guard. As you come to you see people on the ground, some are moving. Others are yelling out in pain as a shower of splinters and stone fall upon them. It is utter chaos in the plaza.
>
>You quickly get to your feet and look around for Gilena but she is gone. The sound of a war horn is heard off in the distance.

The characters are flagged down by a citizen and is informed that Mayor Kensey is asking for them at her estate.

When the characters arrive, Kensey informs them that the fight has already begun and that she has already issued orders to the town's defenders.

After a few moments Kensey spots the enemy command position. They are sitting just outside of the town, on a small hill. She has a hunch that the goblin forces will disperse if the command unit is eliminated and tasks the characters with attacking it.

### Enroute to the Command Unit
As the characters make their way to the hill they are intercepted by a goblin raiding party. The main goal of the fight is to weaken the characters and drain their resources. The raiding party will retreat if they feel the characters are too tough a target.

>The raiding party can consistent of any number of goblinoid creatures. To make the fight more interesting and challenging feel free to include ogres as well.

### Battle for the Hill
Upon reaching the base of the hill the characters are fired upon by four goblins who are positioned at the top and riding upon an ogre howdah. The characters can make out Gilena speaking to **Ovlol**, the hobgoblin commander, before vanishing.

Several hobgoblins surround Ovlol and form a defensive perimeter. The character must succeed a DC 14 Dexterity (Arcobatics) check to avoid the goblin archers and make it up the hill unscathed. Any character that fails the check takes 2d4 piercing damage.

>When combat begins the hobgoblins will attempt to surround the player while the goblins continue to rain arrows from ontop their ogre. The ogre will generally move around behind the hobgoblins and will only attack if all the hobgoblins are defeated or he is engaged by a character.
>
>Ovlol will support his minions as best as he can and will only enter into melee combat once half his hobgoblins are defeated.

## Conclusion
Once Ovlol is defeated, the remaining goblin forces will route and retreat into the surrounding woods. Kensey meets up with the characters and congratulates them on a job well done. With this defeat the Goblin King's army is now in disarray. She believes that it would be best to press the attack and finish the job. Kensey wants to take the fight to the Goblin King first thing in the morning.

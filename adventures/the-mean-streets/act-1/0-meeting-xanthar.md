## Meeting Xanthar
Gilena Mistwalker, teleports the characters to Xanthar's inner sanctum. The room has a very tall ceiling and stone statues of knights stand in each corner. Beautifully rendered landscapes painted on delicate canvases hang on the walls. A chandelier floats in the center of the room providing light for visitors.

### Hook
>The room you were in fades away. Your vision blurs to a white canvas, as if you were blinded by an exploding sun. You hear nothing but the deafening silence. Moments later a clicking-clacking sound registers. The white canvas starts to fade, shapes and colors begin to form. You blink. The clicking-clacking continues. A grandfater clock stares back at you, its pendulum, swinging back and forth, clicking and clacking.
>
>The room around you has few furniture. A chair, a counch and an ornate dresser. What stands out to you is the numerous, beautifully rendered paintings that decorate the walls. If left alone, you may spend the larger part of the day getting lost in them.
>
>Outside, beyond the deep reddish-brown door that seperates this room from the unknown, you hear a voice.
>
>Gilena moves to the door and she motions you to follow...

### Gilena Mistwalker
Gilena is a drow with blue skin and deep read eyes. As a child she was captured by raiding humans when her drow village's hunting party strayed too far to the surface. She would've been sold into slavery at one of Gadgetzan's black markets if it wasn't for Xanthar opening a war against the guild her slave masters had belonged to.

Raised by the beholder, Gilena is his most trusted agent and shares the same aminousity towards humaniods as her master.

### Xanthar the All-Knowing
Xanthar, is a beholder with gold-tinged skin. He is a paranoid and greedy collector of information, wealth, and power. Xanthar views all humaniod races as inferior to his own, only worthy of being slave stock. Despite this desposition, he always treats them with respect or as much respect as one would give to a pet.

Xanthar has schemes within schemes and keeps most to himself. He only shares the most pertinant information with Gilena, who then gives orders to the other agents in their organization to carry out his wishes.

Xanthar is head of the Guild of Dungeoneers and uses it as a hub for gathering information on lost artifacts. Once an item catching his interest is found, he sends out his agents to retrieve them under the guise of a quest.

### The Meeting with the Eye
Xanthar, is currently speaking with a human rogue. The rogue has failed his task at tailing a local nobleman. When Gilena approaches with the characters, Xanthar will disintergrate the rogue with one of his eye attacks before turning to characters with as charming a smile as he can make.

Xanthar is annoyed at the failure and collapse of Torg's goblin army. His original plan was to have Torg raid the frontier towns, causing a spike in demand for his dungeoneers and driving up his profits. He had invested numerous gold into funding the Ogre and his ambitions and now it was all lost. Despite his annoyance, Xanthar has a need for capable adventurers and sees this as a good oppurtunity to aquire more.

Xanthar blames the characters for his losses and presses them to work for him in order to pay it back. The characters have little choice other than to accept. Once they agree to work for him, Xanthar will gift the characters will a small out-of-service tavern located on Wetmarsh Lane within the Docks District of Gadgetzan.

Xanthar will call upon the characters when he has a need for them and advises that they find work in the meantime.

>The characters cannot defeat Xanthar in combat. Any fight will end in them being locked in his dungeon, where he will once again attempt to force them into his services.

## Conclusion
Xanthar sees the characters as an investment and has provided them with a humble start to paying him back.

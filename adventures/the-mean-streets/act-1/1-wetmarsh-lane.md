## Wetmarsh Lane
The Rusty Mug is one of many shops located on Wetmarsh Lane, over the course of the campaign the characters will come to know their neighbors more.

### Rusty Mug Tavern
The Rusty Mug is located on Wetmarsh Lane and is a two story building. The first floor, being a general living area, houses the kitchen, taproom and bathroom. The second floor contains four bedrooms for the characters to either use or rent out to their patrons. Characters can refurnish, rebuild, rename, and otherwise personalize their new home, and business place, to their hearts' content.

#### Tavern Rooms
When the characters first arrive, the tavern's taproom is filled with broken furniture, tarnished silverware. casks of wine that have turned to vinegar. and worthless detritus. The tavern's other rooms are all empty, except for cobwebs, dust, and harmless rats.

#### Harmless Haunt
The tavern is haunted by the poltergiest of its former barkeeper, a half-elf named **Lief**. Maintaining the tavern was her life's work and she couldn't abandon the place in death.

The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can't speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don't take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as "Closing time!" and "Last call!") on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.

**Appeasing Lief.** If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lief can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.

**Destroying Lief.** Lief's poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the tavern when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.

## Opening for Business
Getting a tavern up and running requires the characters work with numerous different guilds, without whose support the business is likely to fail. The sidebar below summerizes the one-time payments and continuing expenses associated with running the tavern in Wetmarsh Lane, as well as providing rules for determining how much coin the business makes or loses.

>**One-Time Expenses**
>- 1,000 gp to renovate the tavern over 12 days
>- 250 gp for guild licenses and contracts (paid up front)
>
>**Regular Expenses**
>- 50 gp per tenday for maintenance and wages of hirelings
>- 10 gp per tenday for all other guild expenses
>
>**Profit or Loss**
>
>At the end of every tenday, roll a d100 + 10 and consult the Running a Business table to determine whether the tavern lost money or earned profit. If the characters spent coin on promoting their business during that tenday, add 1 to the roll for each 1 gp they spent. If the characters have unpaid expenses, subtract 1 from the roll for each 1 gp they owe.

## Conclusion
As the characters spend time in Wetmarsh Lane, words of their heroic deeds begin to spread through the docks. Pretty soon the newly reopened Rusty Mug is full of patrons hoping to meet the local heroes. Every so often, a helpless dock dweller will wander in and seek the help of the characters.

## A Look At the Dead
A string of murders rock the Northern District. Several high profile merchants and business owners have been killed in their homes. The victims are all information brokers for the Guild of Dungeoneers. Gilena recurits the characters to determine why they were targeted.

The information brokers were all killed by an assassin from the Dark Talons. They are hired to track down information on an object known as the Eye of Gul'dan.

### Investigating the Corpse
Gilena uses her influence to get the characters into the mortuary before the body is set to be cremated. The characters are only allowed an hour to investigate the body. The body belonged to a gnome merchant name **Torin**. Torin, when he was alive, had the reputation of being an avid collector of rare artifacts and historical information about them.

Torin is wearing mundane clothing, likely the outfit he was sleeping in when he was killed. His life was ended when his throat was slit. The blade that cut him was so sharp it left his neck bone exposed. There is obvious brusing on his face and torso. Several fingers on his left are broken and there is a single stab wound to his right thigh. A note is tucked deep in his shoes. The note contains the word Gul'dan and it seems to have been hastily written in the victims blood.

Successful Investigation (Intelligence) checks reveal the following information:
- DC 10 - you notice some skin is caught underneath his fingernails.
- DC 10 - you notice the skin is of a dark grayish color.
- DC 15 - you notice 3 scratch marks, resembling scratchs from a claw, on the back of the body.

While investigating the corpse an operative from the Dark Talons observes from a distance. Characters that succeed a DC 12 passive Perception (Wisdom) check notices slight sounds coming from the ceiling of the room for a brief moment.

### Investigating the Residence
Gilena has an idea of who might've been behind these murders but she needs more information on why. She sends the characters to search Torin's home for more clues on "Gul'dan". Torin lives deep within the Northern District and his office is on the second floor. A single window into the room opens to the street below. Gilena has bribed a maid of the family to leave the window open for the characters. Gilena informs the party that an offical investigation has been opened by the City Watch and The Watchful Order. They characters only have a limited amount of time to search Torin's office before the officers arrive.

Torin's office is in disarray. A lamp, with blood splattered on its cover, sits in the north-eastern corner of the room by the door to the hallway. Torin's desk sits by the window and looks to have been ransacked. A small table is overturned and laying on its side next to the western wall. The bookcase on the eastern wall is missing several books. The papers resting all around the room all mention an artifact called the Eye of Gul'dan and a person called **Leolu**.

Successful Investigation (Intelligence) checks reveal the following information:
- DC 10 - Leolu is Torin's colleague and has been helping him track down the eye for his collection.
- DC 10 - The Eye of Gul'dan is a magical artifact capable of capturing arcane energies
- DC 10 - Gul'dan is a long dead lich
- DC 15 - The eye is one of several powerful artifacts belonging to Gul'dan

## Conclusion
The characters meet back up with Gilena and inform her of what they found. Gilena believes that Leolu will be the assassin's next target and directs the characters to her defense.

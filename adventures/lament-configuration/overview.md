## Description
A wealthly and hedonistic merchants enlists the characters to find a relic rumored to grant its owner pleasures beyond mortal means. The characters are told to search the library for clues on it.

The library knows about the relic but it is hidden away somewhere. The attendants are relunctant to reveal any information about the relic to the characters. The characters can find information on the relic when they break into the lead librarians office and raid his safe.

characters return to the merchant with this information. He sends them to explore the dungeon and retrieve the relic. The order meant to watch over the relic finds out about this and seeks to stop the characters (they can also ask the merchant to stop but he wont). Characters and the order fight on the way to the dungeon.

Chararcters explore the dungeon and retrieve the relic.

Characters return the relic to the merchant and help him open it. The room transforms and the relic summons openmind (pinhead-lite). An attractive female demon(?) with the skin from her skull peeled and pinned to her shoulders. Her skull opened exposing her pulsating brain. She takes the merchant after telling him that "it is desire that calls to her, not hands".

The characters need to leave, the merchant is dead and they will be framed for murder otherwise.

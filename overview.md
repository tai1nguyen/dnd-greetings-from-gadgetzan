![Greetings from Gadgetzan](cover.jpg){.size-cover}

# Introduction
Rising out of the northern deserts, a vibrant city, where dreams are made real, stands against the blistering heat. Gagetzan is the capital city for the Gadgeteer Cartel, the largest of the goblin cartels.

Some of the best goblin engineers, miners, and alchemists ply their trade here. The goblins here believe in profit above loyalty, thus Gadgetzan is considered neutral territory in any large-scale conflict. Anyone with a fat wallet or services to offer is welcomed in Gadgetzan.

All governments officially recognize goblin neutrality in the city, and for those who don't, the streets are heavily patrolled by goblin bruisers ready to pound to a pulp anyone disrupting their trade by instigating conflict.

The **Gadgetzan Times** adventure module follows the characters as they try to navigate the city's tumultuous environment. Maybe they'll make a name for themselves amongst the rabble or any enemy of one of the gangs, anything is possible in Gadgetzan.

## Background
The bustling town of Gadgetzan has ushered in a new era of trade, but the city’s success has led to its unfortunate occupation by some rather unruly denizens, each with their own agendas. Crime families run the streets, each led by a powerful figurehead pulling the strings from the shadows.

Nestled deep in the desert, the land-locked goblin town of Gadgetzan was a haven for shady dealings and rule-bending trade, its locals and visitors showing no favoritism toward any government body.

With the construction of its new port, trade boomed in Gadgetzan. The influx of trade stuffed the coffers of those on the ground floor of the development of new Gadgetzan. Everyone who was anyone wanted a piece of the action, using all the tricks up their sleeves to get the upper hand. Organized crime developed as the power struggle began to grow in the now bustling Gadgetzan—it was no longer the sleepy city it once was!

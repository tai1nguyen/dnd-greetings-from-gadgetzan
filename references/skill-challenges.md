## What is a skill challenege?
A skill challenge is an action scene: an adrenaline-fueled dash to the finish line. Whether that’s fleeing a T-Rex, escaping a whirlpool, or finding shelter from zealous guards, skill challenges are opportunities for excitement, tension, and quick thinking.

As the name suggests, skill challenges are trials that the characters can overcome through the judicious use of skills—from Athletics to Survival, carpenter’s tools, vehicle expertise, and more. By using class features, special equipment, racial attributes, or spells, the characters can boost their chances of overcoming dangerous complications that obstruct their path forward—or else fall into failure.

## Building a Skill Challenge
Below follows the general steps for creating memorable skill challenges for your characters.

### 1. Set the Scene
All great action sequences have to take place somewhere. If you need ideas for skill challenges, chases, escapes, and natural disasters often make perfect backdrops. Skill challenge examples might be a high-speed vault heist, a woodland flight from a werewolf pack, or a race through a shark-infested reef.

### 2. Set the Stakes
>A ship that falls into a whirlpool risks destruction. Travelers buried beneath an avalanche face exhaustion and cold—plus days more of travel. Thieves caught in the act might be captured by the Royal Guard. 

Scenes are most engaging when they set clear stakes for victory and failure. Ask yourself: What goal are your PCs pursuing in this skill challenge? What are they risking in the process? What might happen if they fail? Like a good combat encounter, a good skill challenge shines when the consequences are clear.

### 3. Set Difficulty
Skill challenges are divided into “rounds,” each resulting in a single success or failure. The difficulty of a skill challenge is determined by two numbers: the total number of Successes the PCs need to succeed, and the total number of Failures the PCs can earn before failing altogether. The table below shows a few possible difficulties:

| Difficulty | Successes | Failures |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Easy       | 3         | 3        |
| Medium     | 5         | 3        |
| Hard       | 7         | 3        |
| Deadly     | 7         | 2        |

### 4. Choose Complications
>As thieves race through the factory, a crucible of molten steel groans dangerously overhead. As the helmsman navigates the raging storm, a bolt of lightning splits the mast. As the pack’s howls grow closer, bad luck strikes—a sudden crevasse!

Each round of a skill challenge, a new complication arises, forcing the PCs to overcome it—or suffer the consequences. Here are a few broad categories of complications that might appear:

- The terrain changes in a dangerous way (e.g., a crevasse, a geyser field, a bramble patch).

- A dangerous event (e.g., a bolt of lightning, an explosive blast, a splatter of molten magma) strikes nearby.

- A third party (e.g., a beast, a rival, or a civilian) intervenes.

- A hazard appears in the PCs’ path (e.g., razorvine, brown mold, or unstable ground).

- A new danger appears on the horizon (e.g., a hole in a ship’s hull or castle doors that begin to close).

### 5. Set Penalties
Failure has consequences. For each complication, set a corresponding penalty that the party will suffer on a failure. This might be damage (e.g., 2d6 bludgeoning damage for failing to evade a tumbling boulder), a debilitating condition (e.g., a temporary poisoned condition for stumbling into a patch of poison mushrooms), or even levels of exhaustion.

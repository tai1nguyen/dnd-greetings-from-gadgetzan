## Goblin King's Throne
At the top of the stairs the characters come face to face with the Goblin King, Torg, a large ogre with a golden crown on his bald head and a large club in his hand. Torg sits on his throne and standing beside him are his two hobgoblin honor guards.

Torg is arguing with Gilena about her inability to kill the characters at the battle for Riverdale. Gilena does not seem impressed. She says that her master has taken a liking to the characters and forbade her from having anymore direct influences.

At this point both parties notice each other. Gilena tells Torg that now is his chance to kill the characters himself.

## Goblin Throne Room Interior
The following areas correspond to the labels on the provided map.

### 1. Throne Room
A golden throne sits to the south against the wall. A red, dirt stained, carpet stretches from the throne and stops just short of the entrance to the room.

The throne is covered in bones, armor plates, and weapons. Torg sits on it with his club in hand. To either side of him stands a hobgoblin in full plate armor.

Gilena stands off to the side.

To the west is a short hallway that opens up to a smaller room.

To the east stands a locked wooden door. A character that succeeds a DC 15 Dexterity check unlocks the door.

### 2. Waiting Room
The room contains benches along the northern and southern walls. Although most are rotting and crumbling a few can still be used as a seat.

In the center of the room is a large worg. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the center of the room.

### 3. Treasure Room
An ornate treasure chest sits at the back, near the eastern wall. Light shining from the slits in the walls catches on the gold plating of the chest causing it to sparkle.

The chest is unlocked and it contains 500 gold pieces and a set of half plate armor.

### The Final Fight
When combat starts Gilena moves to the back and simply observes.

Torg and his guards will charge the player immediately. The worg in the waiting room (area 2.) also joins the fight. A hobgoblin will mount the worg whenever the chance arises.

Once he is at half health Torg will disengage from the players. He will then spend an action to stomp his feet on the ground, causing the ceiling to come down on the characters. Characters must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the damage. On a failed saving throw they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage. After this attack Torg will engage the characters again in melee.

### Conclusion
After Torg's defeat, Gilena begrudgingly congratulates the characters. She tells them that the goblin forces here will disperse now that their almighty king has been slain.

Gilena gives them the key to the treasure room and informs them that her master, Xanthar the All-Knowing, wishes to meet them. She makes it abundantly clear that it is not a request. She reveals that Torg's success was all due to the support her organization has provided and now that he was dead, and there original plans ruined, the characters have incurred quite the debt.

Gilena offers to transport the players back to town and allow them a day to get their affairs in order before she returns to retrieve them. Once in town the characters can inform Kensey of their successful mission. Kensey will reward the characters with 100 gold pieces and 6 potions of greater healing. She also hosts a small banquet in the characters' honor.

In the morning Gilena returns to retrieve the characters and they are then teleported to one of Xanthar's safe houses, deep within the city of Gadgetzan.

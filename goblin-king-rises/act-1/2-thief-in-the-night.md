## Thief in the Night
The characters begin making camp for the night. They have had a tough day treking through the thick forest and are exhausted. During the night, while they slept, a goblin slipped into the camp and stole a personal artifact for each character. The characters notice they have been robbed in the morning and begin their hunt for the thief.

### Hook
> The trek was long and hard. You feel sweat pooling on your backs and the ache in your feet is becoming unbearable. The journey through the forest was harsh and its constant assualts have etched weariness into your very bones. Up ahead you spot a sturdy oak tree with a full canopy. The promise of escape from the unrelenting sun and the feeling of fatigue in your body makes it the perfect spot for tonight's campsite. You unpack, relax and begin the ritual of rest and recovery.

### An Uninvited Guest
In the night a goblin sneaks into camp to rob the characters. The thief makes it out undetected and the characters learn of the robbery in the morning. You can roll on the table below to determine what was stole from each character.

| d4 | Stolen Item               |
|----|---------------------------|
| 1  | Tool or toolkit           |
| 2  | Armor piece               |
| 3  | Weapon                    |
| 4  | Gold pouch                |

>On a successful DC 14 passive Wisdom (Perception) check, the characters notice the goblin before it can rob them and the chase begins immediately.

### The Hunt Begins
As the goblin fled it left a trail for the characters. Following the trail the characters catches a glimpse of the thief. Unfortunately, it also sees them and starts to dash away. So the hunt begins!

As the characters rush to catch up to the thief, roll on the [chase complications table](../../.references/tables/chase-complications.md) to determine the complication, difficulty class and ability check each characters need to overcome. On a success, that character is closer to catching the goblin. A character catches up to the goblin after 5 successes and loses the trail after 3 failures.

### Resolving the Chase
Whether or not the characters catch up to the goblin, they will arrive at a clearing and on the ground in the center will be their stolen equipment. The goblin they have been chasing is exhausted and cannot run anymore. It is catching its breath admist a pile of the characters' possessions.

On a successful DC 14 passive Wisdom (Perception) check, the character realize that they are being watched from beyond the treeline.

When the characters reach the center of the clearing, the goblins in hiding will launch their attack. The exhausted goblin will retreat from combat.

### Conclusion
The characters are able to retrieve their stolen gear and in the distance they find the goblin thief cowering behind a knocked down tree.

She introduces herself as Gnil. She is extremely scared and pleads with the characters to spare her life. She explains that her tribe was forced into joining the Goblin King's army. Her people are primarily foragers and they are not used to this method of war. Gnil goes on to say that her mission is to retrieve the gear left here by the raiding party and to take them to a nearby crypt for storage.

>If the characters decide to kill Gnil they can find a scroll with orders from the Goblin King telling her to retrieve the stolen gear and a map with the location of the crypt marked on it.

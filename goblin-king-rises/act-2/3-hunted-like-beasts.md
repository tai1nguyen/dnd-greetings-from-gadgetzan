## Hunted Like Beasts
As the characters make their way back to town with Krel, a group of hobgoblins follow behind them. The hobgoblins of the Beast Trapper clan are tasked with killing Krel. They are promised riches and a place as one of the Goblin King's royal guard forces. To the Beast Trapper clan hunting is a competitive sport. Their leader is an agile hobgoblin named Duzurg.

### The Hunt Begins
The first hobgoblin to catch up to the characters is the male Krekud. He wears a magical amulet that allows him to disguise himself. He has already used it to disguise as a lost human traveler. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Krekud seems at home in the woods. Krekud waits until he is alone with one of the characters and then attacks. He fights until he is reduced to half hit points and then flees.

### Night Stalkers
After the encounter with Krekud (or perhaps while he still travels with the characters), Aknorg and Erbun, a male and female hobgoblin respectively, stalk the party for a day. A character succeeding a DC 16 passive Wisdom (Perception) check notices them. The hobgoblins wait until the characters camp and then attack. If Krekud is with the characters, he attacks as well, hoping to kill more than his clanmates.

### The Solitary Hunter
Gred, Duzurg's eldest son and hunt master to the Beast Trapper clan, stalks the characters from a distance. The hobgoblin stays just within long range of his longbow and shoots several arrows at the characters before retreating to hide. He attacks once per hour this way. The characters can track Gred with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check and sneak up on him with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

### Wild Chase
Madeg, Rorz, Zagrorg, and Verdag, four Beast Trapper Clan members shoot warning arrows at the characters when they are 300 feet away. This force then charges toward the characters. They are likely too strong for the characters to take head-on, so make that clear.

As the characters flee, use the following table to determine the complication, difficulty class and ability test needed to be overcome by each character. On a success, that particular character is closer to escaping the clan. The characters escape once a character succeeds 5 complications and are caught once a character has failed 3.

### Confronting the Hunters
After losing many members of his clan to the characters, Duzurg, a one-eyed hobgoblin with 150 hit points, approaches them with his worg. Duzurg asks them to pick their most formidable warrior to battle him one-on-one to the death. If he loses, the Beast Tracker clan will stop hunting the characters. If the character loses, Duzurg will take that loss as retribution for his lost clan members and cease the hunt.

If the characters do not agree, both Duzurg and his worg attack. If they agree and a champion is chosen, the hobgoblins follow the terms of the deal. If a character other than the chosen warrior participates in the battle in any way, the deal is broken and both Duzurg and his worg try to kill all the characters. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check allows a character to subtly help the champion without the hobgoblin noticing â€“ such as casting a healing spell.

### Conclusion
The characters escape the Beast Trapper clan and arrive at the outskirts of the town. They are exhausted but push on to get Krel to safety. Unfortunately, Krel stumbles and reveals that he has been wounded by the Beast Trapper clan during their escape. The wound was made with necrotic energies and cannot be healed by normal means.

Krel thanks the characters and tells them that he knows that they had a hand in clearing out the goblins storage crypt. He warns that the Goblin King will be planning to attack the town as soon as possible in order to save face and maintain his position as sovereign. Krel advises that the characters head back to town and help prepare their whatever defenses they can.

With his last breath, Krel provides the players with a map detailing the location of the Goblin King's fortress.

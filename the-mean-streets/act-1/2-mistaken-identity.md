## Mistaken Identity
As the characters go about their day, a tax offical mistakenly recognizes a character to be a known tax evader. He starts to hound the characters and demand they pay their dues.

The tax collector will not take "no" for an answer and will not leave them alone until they either, flee and successfully lose him in the city streets or repay the sum of coin he demands.

### Hook
>You walk down Fifth Avenue searching for a butcher shop. The tavern has run low on meats and is in need of a resupply. Across the street you spy a man dressed in a fine uniform. It takes several moments before you realize that the uniform belongs to the tax collection arm of the government. Your eyes brief meet before you turn the corner and head down a separate road.
>
>You get in ten paces before you hear a voice calling you from behind. You turn to see the tax collector hurrying over to you.
>
>"I recognize you!", says the man. You can tell he is irritated, despite this being your first meeting with him.
>
>"It's time you pay up," he extends an open hand. "I won't be tricked again!"
>
>You explain that he is mistaken but he won't have any of it. He threatens to call the City Watch if you do not pay him the taxes he believes you owe.

### The Converstation
The man is visibly again. He is a tax collector for the city and will not let the characters move on without first paying a tax of 500 gp. When the characters try to convince him that he is speaking to the wrong person, he will immediately make a scene and start calling for the City Watch.

At this point the characters should run. If they wait for the City Watch to arrive, they will be arrested.

### On the Run
As the characters flee, use the [chase complications table](../../references/tables/chase-complications.md) to determine the complication, difficulty class and ability test needed to be overcome by each character. On a success, that particular character is closer to losing the tax collector. The characters escape once a character succeeds 5 complications and are caught once a character has failed 3.

### Conclusion
If the characters escape they meet up back at the Rusty Mug and enjoy a round of beer. Otherwise, if a character has been caught, they will be taken down to the Govern District and charged with tax evasion. They will are released and return to the tavern a little bit after the other characters.

Regardless of the outcome, the characters failed to restock the tavern's meat and will have to do so some other day.

>You can determine what the penalty is for being charged with tax evasion. Generally, in Gadgetzan it would be a fine but its not unheard of to have convicted individuals give back to the local community via service hours.
